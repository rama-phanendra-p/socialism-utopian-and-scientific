The Unquiet Engine: An Interactive Guide to Engels' "Socialism"
This project is a single-page interactive web application designed to make the core concepts of Friedrich Engels' seminal work, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, accessible and engaging for a modern audience.
It translates the dense philosophical and economic arguments of the text into a guided, visual experience. The goal is to help users explore, understand, and synthesize the key ideas from the early "Utopian" socialists to the materialist conception of history and the fundamental contradictions of capitalism.

Features
This application is built as a single-page experience, divided into three main thematic sections that guide the user through Engels' argument:
I. The Dreamers: An introduction to the three great "Utopian" socialistsâ€”Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Robert Owen. This section uses interactive cards to present their key ideas in a digestible format.
II. The Method: A visual explainer that contrasts the static "Metaphysical" worldview with the dynamic, process-oriented thinking of "Dialectics," which Engels established as the foundation for scientific socialism. Users can toggle between the two views to compare them directly.
III. The Engine: An exploration of the "fundamental contradiction" of capitalism. This section includes:
A flow diagram illustrating the conflict between Social Production and Private Appropriation.
An interactive line chart visualizing the periodic "boom-bust" cycles of economic crisis that Engels described as a "crisis of superabundance."
How to Use
Navigation: Use the fixed navigation bar at the top to scroll smoothly between the three main sections: "The Dreamers," "The Method," and "The Engine." On mobile devices, a dropdown menu is available.
Tooltips: In "The Engine" section, hover over the diagram elements to see direct quotes from Engels' text, providing context for the concepts.
Interactive Toggle: In "The Method" section, click the buttons to switch between the "Metaphysical View" and the "Dialectical View" to understand their core differences.
